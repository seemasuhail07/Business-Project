This is a business project to understand the factors/predictors that drive disability.
This was tested with data extracted from various ONS surveys that are carried out in United Kingdom.
Different feature selection methods were applied by executing separate code for each selection method.
Best models were chosen
There are 6 python source files with their data analysis based on different selection methods
and one tableau source file that has graphical analysis.
